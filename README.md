TODO:

*	Add int, double, and float tests to main function (string should already be there)

*	Comment and document with doxygen

*	Complete documentation

*	Fix the problems to get the program to compile on the lab computers (THIS SHOULD BE THE VERY LAST TASK TO COMPLETE)

	I think that is all of the tasks that need to be completed. Please try and work on these tasks.
